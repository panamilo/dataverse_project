Application is now deployed on heroku. Only some minor bugs and details need polishing!|


To run the app locally you need to :

1) cd into projects directory
2) npm install (if you have done this once SKIP this step.)
3) node server.js
4) cd into Client
5) npm install (if you have done this once SKIP this step.)
6) npm start
7) browse to your localhost adress you have chosen and see the app running!


This is a project I recently made using React,Node,Express,MaterialUI and Postgresql.

The project resembles a simple blog project. User can create/edit/delete articles and assign them to categories he creates.


The landing page of the project is also the home page of the app. (there is no auth factor at the moment)

Clicking on the drawer button on the side you can see the categories that are currently available and/or create/delete one.

Clicking on the Show more toggle button you can see the details of the article you want.

Clicking on the CREATE button on the Appbar the user can create a new article with his respective choices just like in the screen below:

Similarly he can drop an article using the DELETE button on the home page

Or he can edit the article he wants by clicking the EDIT button and filling in the new information.

That concludes the core functionalities of the project. You can see more in depth of what and how is done by inspecting the code.
